				<p>How you receive your counselling is a individual choice and will vary from person to
					person. I would be pleased
					to welcome you to my counselling room near Andover, but I equally understand and
					respect the advantages that
					telephone and online counselling offer. I have chosen to use Zoom for my online
					sessions. I currently work from
					Tuesdays to Fridays from 8am â€“ 8pm and on Saturday morning between 9am and 12pm.</p>
				<p>In advance of the first counselling session being confirmed, I offer a 20 minute
					initial consultation free of
					charge. This is to check a number of factors to ensure that we both feel that we
					would be a good fit to work
					together, such as your reasons for considering counselling and what to expect during
					your counselling experience.
					This consultation takes place over the phone or on Zoom.</p>
