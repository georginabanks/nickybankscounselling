				<p>Hi, I’m Nicky. Welcome to my website.</p>
				<p>I live on the Hampshire/Wiltshire border and offer confidential online and telephone
					counselling to adults across the UK,
					as well as face-to-face counselling to the local community.</p>
				<p>I work with individuals who are feeling “stuck” – who wish to change their life in some
					way to feel stronger and more
					confident in themselves but don’t know where or how to start. Does this sound familiar
					to you? Would you like to explore
					these thoughts and feelings in a supportive and non-judgemental environment? If the
					answer is ‘yes’ to these questions,
					please get in touch to arrange a free initial consultation.</p>
				<p>Previous client work has included such topics as invisible illness (such as
					fibromyalgia), relationship problems,
					emotional eating, the impact of difficult childhood experiences in adulthood, anxiety,
					grief and loss. I have had
					particular experience working with domestic abuse survivors as a counsellor at the local
					women’s refuge.</p>
