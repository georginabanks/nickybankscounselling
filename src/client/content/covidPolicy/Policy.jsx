				<p>If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, or have been asked to self-isolate, please do not
					attend your counselling
					session. Please notify me in advance and I will offer you a telephone or Zoom session at your
					usual or an alternate time,
					if you feel able to manage this, or rearrange the face-to-face session to a date when it is safe
					to meet in person. NB.
					Please ask me or check your contract for the cancellation policy.</p>
				
				<p>I will complete lateral flow tests twice weekly and will inform you if there is a positive test
					result. Sessions will be
					offered remotely instead, as long as I am well enough to proceed, until my isolation period is
					completed. Should I need
					to give your contact details to Track & Trace, I will not disclose our relationship.</p>
				
				<p>My priority is to ensure that COVID-19 has as little impact on your therapy as possible. I will
					work flexibly with you to
				meet your needs and keep you safe.</p>
