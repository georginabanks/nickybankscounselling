				<p>I am a mum to two young adults. As a stay-at-home mum, I knew that when I went back
					to work, I wanted to find a
					new career that I was passionate about and I feel so lucky to have found it.</p>
				<p>I have spent the past several years retraining as a counsellor. I volunteered as a
					counsellor at the local women’s
					refuge, both during my training and afterwards.</p>
				<p>Now I’ve finished studying, I’m looking forward to spending time attending live
					theatre and music venues in the
					coming months now they are more easily accessible.</p>
