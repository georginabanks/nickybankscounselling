				<p>A number of life experiences and choices led me to an introductory course in Counselling Skills
					although my lack of self-confidence
					and anxiety within a learning environment meant that it took two years to submit the application
					form! The course piqued my
					interest as something to be explored further and I knew that, in some form, I had found my new
					career. </p>
				<p>With hindsight, becoming a qualified counsellor has been signposted to me both consciously and
					unconsciously over the years.
					It links to my previous job as an Account Manager through my desire to work in partnership with
					people to find the resources
					and skills needed to help them achieve a less stressful, more positive way of living or working.
					I have also personally witnessed
					the impact a compassionate listener can have and I felt that this was a world of which I wanted
					to gain a greater understanding.</p>
				<p>I am excited to offer clients face-to-face sessions in my new <a href="/counselling-room">
					counselling room near Andover</a>.</p>
