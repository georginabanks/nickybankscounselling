				<p>There are a number of other businesses in Little Ann Bridge Farm, and it is important that
					you feel comfortable when
					arriving and leaving your counselling session. For this reason, I suggest the following:</p>
				<p>If you are driving, please wait in your car until a couple of minutes until your session time
					then sit in the lobby area
					until called. For those arriving on foot, please enter the annexe on arrival and wait in the
					lobby area until called.</p>
