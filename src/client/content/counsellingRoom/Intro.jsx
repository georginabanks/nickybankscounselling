				<p>I have a wheelchair accessible counselling room in a quiet courtyard in a rural setting on
					the outskirts of Andover. Itâ€™s
					cosy and comfortable with a window that lets in natural light and fresh air. There is a
					heater and a blanket for your use
					in the colder months of the year. Bathroom facilities are also available. Privacy and
					confidentiality are assured. There
					is plenty of parking directly outside the room.</p>
