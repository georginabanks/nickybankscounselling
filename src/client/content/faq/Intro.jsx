				<p>Counselling means many things to many people so the questions that come to mind about
					the counselling process and
					the commitment by both client and counsellor are extremely varied. For this reason,
					I have chosen to briefly answer
					the questions that I am asked the most by potential clients. These are found below.
					Should you have any further
					questions about counselling in general or how we would work together – and you can’t
					find them elsewhere on the
					website – <a href="/contact">please get in touch.</a></p>
