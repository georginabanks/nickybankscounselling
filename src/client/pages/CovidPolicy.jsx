					<p className="below-intro">Below are the procedures I will be following to minimise risk to
						everyone:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The counselling rooms and waiting area will be thoroughly cleaned every day. All furniture
							will be sprayed with
							anti-bacterial spray after each client and door handles wiped.
						</li>
						<li>The window in the counselling room will be open in between client sessions and can remain
							open during the session at the
							request of the client.
						</li>
						<li>Hand sanitiser is available for use.</li>
						<li>The social distancing guidance will be followed within the confines of the room size.
							Clients are welcome to use a face
							mask if desired.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, or have been asked to self-isolate, please do not
						attend your counselling
						session. Please notify me in advance and I will offer you a telephone or Zoom session at your
						usual or an alternate time,
						if you feel able to manage this, or rearrange the face-to-face session to a date when it is safe
						to meet in person. NB.
						Please ask me or check your contract for the cancellation policy.</p>
					
					<p>I will complete lateral flow tests twice weekly and will inform you if there is a positive test
						result. Sessions will be
						offered remotely instead, as long as I am well enough to proceed, until my isolation period is
						completed. Should I need
						to give your contact details to Track & Trace, I will not disclose our relationship.</p>
					
					<p>My priority is to ensure that COVID-19 has as little impact on your therapy as possible. I will
						work flexibly with you to
						meet your needs and keep you safe.</p>
					
					<p>This policy is consistently under review and was last updated on 09/11/21.</p>
